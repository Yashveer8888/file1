# Geometry Management
pack():	The Pack geometry manager packs widgets in rows or columns.
grid():	The Grid geometry manager puts the widgets in a 2-dimensional table. 
The master widget is split into a number of rows and columns, and each “cell” in the resulting 
table can hold a widget.
place():	The Place geometry manager is the simplest of the three general geometry managers
provided in Tkinter. 
It allows you explicitly set the position and size of a window, either in absolute terms,
or relative to another window.
