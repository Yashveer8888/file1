# what is label?
'''Label widgets are used to display text or images. The text displayed by a Label widget can’t be edited by the user. It’s for display purposes only. As you saw in the example at the beginning of this tutorial, you can create a Label widget by instantiating the Label class and passing a string to the text parameter:'''

import tkinter as tk
label = tk.Label(text="Hello, Tkinter")

# You can control Label text and background colors using the foreground and background parameters:
import tkinter as tk
w=tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(text="Hello, Tkinter",foreground="white",  # Set the text color to whitebackground="black"  # Set the background color to black).pack()
w.mainloop()

# You can also specify a color using hexadecimal RGB values:
label = tk.Label(text="Hello, Tkinter", background="#34A2FE")  #  #34A2FE--> blue

# You can also control the width and height of a label with the width and height parameters:
label = tk.Label(text="Hello, Tkinter",fg="white",bg="black",width=10,height=10).pack()
